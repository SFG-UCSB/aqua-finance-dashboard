This dashboard was built to help visualize the magnitude and timeliness of expected cash flows associated with starting an aquaculture farm. Its interactive design gives users the flexibility to configure the underlying bio-economic model to fit their specifications. We intend for this app to serve as a base platform that can be adapted and customized to match different geographies and scales of production, and provide more detailed results that are explicit for any given aquaculture initiative.  We hope our financial tool will encourage more robust stakeholder participation in aquaculture planning, thereby fostering a more cohesive coastal economy and improving future planning processes.
