This dashboard was built to help visualize the magnitude and timeliness of expected cash flows associated with starting an aquaculture farm. Its interactive design gives users the flexibility to configure the underlying bio-economic model to fit their specifications. SFG's goal is to provide a base platform that can be extended in support of sustainable aquaculture initiatives around the world. We hope to improve the marine planning process by arming stakeholders with clear relevant information relevant to their specific circumstances and help foster a more cohesive coastal economy.
